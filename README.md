# What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is the field of study that enables computers to see and identify digital images and videos as a human would. The challenges it faces largely follow from the limited understanding of biological vision. Computer Vision involves acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images to extract high-dimensional data from the real world in order to generate symbolic or numerical information which can then be used to make decisions. The process often includes practices like object recognition, video tracking, motion estimation, and image restoration.
